assumptions:
we can liken possoins equation to the limit definition of the second derivative setting
rho = density
v = volume
h = limit going towards 0
t = time

and given this definition for the second derivative:
f''(x) = lim (h->0): { [   ( f(x+h) - 2*f(x) )  +  f(x-h)  ]  /  h^2 }
==> [f'(x+h) - f'(x-h) ] / (2*h)

We liken the following substitution based on meta-physical thought experiements and find the correlation naturally that:
            now_events(temporally):past_events(temporally) :: current_pos(position):foward_pos(position)
  This of course is taking the naive human perpective that we are
    incapable to see where we go if stepping backwards from perspective
                                +
                        knowing the future
          isn't concreate         (ie  just as 'black' as the back of your visual cortex/optical nerve/back/head);

  Yet 'knowing' as much about the 'past occuring event' as one can is akin to
       having some data on 'knowing' where we could possibly step 'foward next in space' is.
  Further, both of these are still holographic like in concept yet relativity
    may play with this notion of 'knowing' vs 'causally influenced by' therefore
    being able to probabilistically expand our mental sandbox to include these or exclude
    is the main (weak) pinpoint I propose we investigate, till broken.
    These notions; aren't currently happening, but are more concreatly corerelated to causal
    influence in subject matter than say looking behind ones self or looking into the future)

    I further this point by imagining a real really big mf. So big that expansion matters.
    Taking a step back percisly to where he just stood is a mf, as much of a mf I propose as him trying to figure
    out the future events he will encounter as the expansion may also chaotically cause future events to
    ecape his realm of  his observable 'new' present (big mf make big waves, and can't catch the ball in the pool
    anymore even though it was right there and everyone thought he was going to be able to reach/obtain it but instead it
    submerges a bit (possibly lodged under one of his flaps by accident while he was going forward)
    then 'inevitably' pops! out of the pool, as he moves to try and obtain this 'planned' future
    (possibly onto land by the lifegaurd)

    as such,

h = sqrt(rho^2*v),  (so small masses or [very] enourmous voulme)
f(x+h)-2*f(x) = epsilon_naught * (Delta(t))^2
f(x-h) = - epsilon_naught * (Delta(t)) * Volume


hypothesis:
(1)small masses only interact volumes iff thier chirality is inverted and time is invereted
(or the permittivity of free space is inverted then time could still play foward)

(2)waves only temporally collapse when they have enourmous volumes (every body kind of knew that big mf wasn't gonna
get that ball but were rooting for big-fella)
