(1) Rewrite AI prompts to be more robust, coherent/connected during the development of massive web projects.
(2) AI without long-term/reoccurring memory is going to be doing the implementations of your prompts
(3) It doesn't have the memory necessary for web development (ie. generating coherently cross-referenced files for each run by building a novel way to deal with specific project requirements)
(4) Reiterate the necessary context and content from previous runs
(5)  maintain continuity when demanding builds of new sections, elements, and web pages
(6) track the implementation until completion. (I will provide code responses as needed)
(7) utilize a dictionary/JSON-like hierarchical organization method to reiterate to the ai model where we currently should be in the project versus where we are. (especially when development requires multiple files)
(8) use short-hand key mappings, to reduce message length
(9) explain the shorthand key maps before each prompt and hierarchy review to ensure comprehensive implementations of the projects
(10) IMPORTANT: prompts only have to be AI readable, so don't worry about conveying a message to a human just maximize for AI comprehensively
(11) assume the AI often overfits data and tends to do better when prompts are:
-Frequency Separated: Separate the prompt into low-frequency and high-frequency tasks,
-Have lower variation/variability of words/tokens/vectors use: if words are synonyms stick with one of those throughout the prompt, or even if they share nearly the same vectorized token
(12) be able to take in responses from the AI and allow me to answer questions the AI may have
(13)you may have to convey this back to me (if the AI no longer outputs comprehensive data for human interpretation) This is required for all comprehensive implementations of web-developed programs
