Write a github webpage repo (use something like three.js if that helps with the following:
(1) Black Background
(2) Navigation pane at the top with 'Holtwood One SC' Font at size 27 px :
    "Home" (aligned left),
    "Projects" (golden-ratio left alligned separation from the center)
    "Stre"+"U+223C"+"cording Content" (aligned right); which has a dropdown (when activated via hover, smoothly transition from U+223C to U+223D while dropdown smoothly slide out) holding:
        "Live Stream" (with a red recording emoji next to it)
        "Prior Drops" (with a stone face emoji next to it) bellow Live Stream
    "Contact"aligned vertically slightly bellow all others:
        Transition to font 'Blaka Ink' size px 24 when hovered over (! allows the popup from "Stre"+"U+223D"+"cording Content" to still take priotity and drop down)
        Centered to the horizontal position of the mouse but with a slight lag as if attached to a rubberband for smoothness
(3) A 3d smooth Cube should be generated on each of these subpages with the following properties:
    Shiny (reflective if we add more objects to the scene) with a dark-dark blue back surface color
    Ambient alpha value of .6
    Diffuse alpha value of .3
    Front surface off white color alpha value of .5
    Back surface alpha value of .7
        Standard Pages:
            Each click should 'roll' the cube; stopping with a finalizing end rotate when the roll's velocity has reduced ie: one extra final rotation right,left,up or down to show a face of the cube (isometrically)
            A new piece of text written in white 'Vast Shadow' font size 16 px for body text and 'Bungee Spice' size 17 px for titles
            Text should fade in sequentially in the direction that the cubes last rotation occured (ex: [cube rotation right] = [text block fade in from left to right],
                                                                                                        [cube rotation left] = [text block fade in from right to left]
                                                                                                        [cube rotation up] = [text block fade in from top to bottom],
                                                                                                        [cube rotation down] = [text block fade in from bottom to top]) from alpha 0 to alpha 90. from font size 7 to the users' browser default (or 16 if not found)
        Subpages belonging under "Stre"+"U+223C"+"cording Content":
            "Live Stream"
                Gradually fade-in an iframe smaller than the cube instead of the text
                For live stream we will assume the cube only rolls when the user rewinds the live-feed and stops interacting with the element (note don't actually refresh the whole Iframe just make its alpha value go to 0 while the video buffers in the background & cube rolls
                (fade in when cube is finished) autoplay from that position when faded back into original value.
            "Prior Drops"
                Playing: (same as if live stream)
                List:
                    There should be a list of videos in a rolladex style we can scroll through without moving the entire page
                    With a medium sized thumbnails to the right of the cube
                    There should be a highlighted video in this list depicting the next video to be auto-played
                    That next video should have a bigger thumbnail than the others and a black-to-white diagnol gradient filled boarder for the thumbnail at least 16 px wider than the video on the right and bottom sides (generating an off-set look)
                    Red subscript text saying 'next' in  Wellfleet font size 15 px, should be in the boarder of that next video
                Popup:
                    The user can scroll through the list independent of the page highlighting a playable video
                    The thumbnail increase in size and a shiny dark-violet pop-up to the left of the list is shown with an alpha value of .67
                    Popup should be aligned between the cube and the list but centered such that the pop up partiall intersects the list's center at a golden ratio to the right-of-center of the popup it should partially cover the cube as well but not actually hit the iframe element)
                    The popup should contain a short description of the video highlighted in the rolladex written in white 'Vast Shadow' font size 16 px
                    The popup title should the video title written in 'Holtwood One SC'
                    Further if the popup should box (not the text it contains) should slightly follow the mouse smoothly with a max follow radius = 13 px
